                     There are some basic syntax rules when working with JavaScript as well as some basic conventions. For example, it is important that
                     <em>we terminate all statements with a</em>
                     <span class="em" data-toggle="tooltip" title=";"><content=>semi-colon.</content=></span>
                     This will ensure that we don't have any issues with one statement bleeding into another:

                     It is important not to confuse
                     <em>assignment operators</em>
                     with
                     <em>comparison operators.</em>
                     Doing so can result in overwriting a value or a reference error.

                  <p>

                     will be equal to
                     <em>15.</em>
                     This may seem confusing but if you follow the steps you will see what has happened here:

                     <li>

                        <em>x</em>
                        and gave it the value of
                        <em>5.</em>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Attempted to see if
                        <em>x</em>
                        is equal to
                        <em>10</em>
                        but instead accidentally
                        <em>assigned 10 to x.</em>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Because the evaluation doesn't
                        <em>explicitly equal false</em>
                        the condition block will execute resulting in

                  <p>
                     Writing comments in JavaScript is quite simple. JavaScript supports
                     <em>single-line comments</em>
                     as well as
                     <em>multi-line comments.</em>
                     Below is an example of both:
                  </p>
                  <pre class='line-numbers' data-start='1'><code class='language-javascript'>// This is a single-line comment.
// So is this.
// This too.

/*
  This is a multi-line
  comment. Notice how it
  spans across multiple
  lines.  
*/
/* This is also a multi-line comment. */</code></pre>
                  <p>
                     <em>Single-line comments</em>
                     are prefixed by the
                     <em>//</em>
                     syntax.
                     <em>Multi-line comments</em>
                     are wrapped using the
                     <em>/* and */</em>
                     syntax.

                     <em>Arrays</em>
                     are essentially
                     <em>lists of items.</em>
                     In most strict languages, these list must be the same data type. However, in JavaScript, arrays can be composed of many different types of data.
                     <small class="em note"><content=>While this is possible, it is not considered best practice. It is much easier to work with data when it is consistently the same structure and type.</content=></small>

                  <p>
                     <em>Arrays</em>
                     in other languages often have to be pre-declared with a set size. In JavaScript, this is unnecessary. Arrays can be various sizes and will tend to shrink and grow as the array progresses through your application.

                  <p>
                     The syntax for arrays in JavaScript is similar to the syntax in many other languages:

                     meaning if want to access the first item in the array you have to use
                     <em>[0].</em>
                     This is common in most languages and hopefully shouldn't be new.

                     <em>JavaScript console</em>
                     is a way for us to debug our code and review output.
                     <em>The console is tremendously powerful and crucial to being a good JavaScript developer.</em>
                     In order to output informationt to the console, we must learn an important command:

                     <em>Nested arrays</em>
                     are simply

                     Nested arrays are common and can be sometimes difficult to work with as they often require nested iterations in order to work with the data. That being said, it is important to be able to recognize a nested array, and access the data within a nested array.

                     Below is an example of a nested array. The idea here is that we're storing 3 students; we're using nested arrays to keep our data types separate and taking advantage of the array indexes to put them back together.

                     In the above example you can see why arrays aren't necessarily the best for this type of data, but this is exactly how most tabular data is stored. The main difficulty with this is if we have a student that needs to be added in before Sally, or perhaps after Dave. We would have to keep track of their index and write large algorithms to process changes like that.

                     <em>

                  <p>
                     I'm going to use the terminology
                     <em>properties to describe values in an object</em>
                     and
                     <em>methods to describe functions in an object.</em>
                     This may seem like a no-brainer, but for absolute transparency
                     <em>objects in JavaScript only have properties,</em>

                     Knowing how many items (elements) are in an array is an important concept, especially when working with dynamically sizable arrays. The reason it's valuable is because often we want to validate the array has content, that the array has a range of items, or we want to

                  <p>
                     As said before, most things in JavaScript are objects, and that applies to arrays. This means that array values have properties and methods available to us. If we want to quickly see a list of those methods, we can simply begin typing
                     <em>[].</em>
                     in our console and we will see a hint list of properties and methods available to the array object

                     As I said before, knowing how many elements an array has can be handy especially when we want to loop over them. We can use a handy property to access the array size known as
                     <em>length.</em>

                     <em>The above code</em>
                     will iterate 10 times, each time adding the value of
                     <em>i</em>
                     to the nums array. The structure for a
                     <em>for loop</em>
                     is as follows:
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     Sometimes you may see this structure written differently as some of the arguments are optional. The above is the most common way it's written.

                     Arrays in JavaScript have special loop structures just for them. The
                     <em>for/of loop</em>
                     is a human-readable way to iterate over items in the array list and perform operations on each specific element. Objects also have their own special loop. These loop structures were introduced in
                     <em>ES5</em>
                     and have become integral to clean readable JavaScript programming.

                     <em>The above code</em>
                     illustrates how to iterate over an array and access each element. Notice the use of
                     <em>.length.</em>
                     This helps us set how many times we want to iterate.

                     makes use of the ES5 for/of loop structure. This syntax makes it a lot easier to work with arrays as it eliminates the need to count the array.
